1. What is functional programming?
- a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects

3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
- The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts.

4. What is immutability?
- Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.
- When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

5. What is Referential transparency?
- if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input

### pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency
