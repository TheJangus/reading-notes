**Control Flow**
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.
Control flow means that when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

* When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
* When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
* Automatically (self invoked)

When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing.

Why Functions?
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.

Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.

Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.

Adding two numbers, will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string:
