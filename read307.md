## [How I explained REST to my brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
- an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.

2. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- they weren't designed to be used like that. being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- REST - is all about applying verbs to nouns

4. What does a `GET` do?
- Retrieves information from systems

5. What does a `POST` do?

6. What does `PUT` do?
