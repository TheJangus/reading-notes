CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc
inside braces are 'declarations'
language is broken down into modules
it is a rule based language
"As a newcomer to CSS, it is likely that you will find the CSS specs overwhelming — they are intended for engineers to use to implement support for the features in user agents, not for web developers to read to understand CSS. "
Browser compatibility is important

[How to Add CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp)
-External CSS = whole site
-Internal CSS = individual page 
-Inline CSS = individual element *do not use*

Cascading Order
All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:

1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
3. Browser default
