## My reading notes for CodeFellows

*notes go here...or something, I'm not the boss*

Hello, jangus here...just trying to make it

Growth mindset is...getting knocked down seven times, dust yourself off and try again

- You've been walking and chewing for over 30 years, yet every now and then you may trip over your feet or bite your tongue - mistakes happen
- You'll often pass failute on your path to success
- Regret isn't trying and failing, regret is failing to ever try
