Hello, jangus here...just trying to make it

[Growth mindset](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/inside-atlassian/growth-mindset) is...getting knocked down seven times, dust yourself off and try again

- You've been walking and chewing for over 30 years, yet every now and then you may trip over your feet or bite your tongue - mistakes happen
- You'll often pass failure on your path to success
- Regret isn't trying and failing, regret is failing to ever try
- *"Just do it."* - ~~Nike~~  Shia LaBeouf
