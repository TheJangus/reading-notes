Explain “growth mindset” in your own words...
....failure is not an option, but something to propel you towards success

4 reminders to keep myself in the growth mindset:
* you will always pass failure on the way to success
* when you get knocked down seven times, dust yourself off and try again
* you've been around for 30+ years walking and eating, yet, every now-and-then you'll trip over your feet or bite your tongue. mistakes happen.
* ***"Just Do It"*** - ~~Nike~~ Shia Labeouf
