## [CSS
Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?
- The transform CSS property lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate an element. It modifies the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model

2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.
- CSS Transform: Scale The scale() method changes the size of the target element. If we provide one argument, this increases or decreases the size of our div by a multiple of its original size.

## [CSS Transitions &
Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

1.What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?
- With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?
-  CSS transitions are generally best for simple from-to movements, while CSS animations are for more complex series of movements.
-  TRANSITITIONS :Can only move from initial to final state — no intermediate steps
Can only run once
Require a trigger to run (like mouse hover)
Run forwards when triggered and in reverse when trigger is removed
Easier to use with JavaScript
Best for creating a simple change from one state to another

- ANIMATIONS: Can move from initial to final state, with intermediate steps in between
Can loop infinitely thanks to animation-iteration-count property
Can be triggered but can also run automatically
Can run forwards, in reverse, or alternate directions
More difficult to use with JavaScript
Best for creating a complex series of movements

## [8 simple CSS3 transitions that will wow your
users](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/05/8-simple-css3-transitions-that-will-wow-your-users/)

1. What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?
- CSS transitions offer you a way to create simple animations that always start as the result of triggering a CSS property change. Transitions can animate only between a start and end state, and each state is controlled by existing CSS property values. CSS animations provide a bit more control. They allow for the creation of multiple keyframes

2. How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?
- Another option, and the one I recommend, is to treat CSS animations as part of the noncritical experience. Use animations to enhance the design and the design’s aesthetic, but make sure nothing breaks in browsers that don’t support CSS animations. Your site should still work in any browser that doesn’t support animations, but it can provide a more enjoyable experience for those that can.
