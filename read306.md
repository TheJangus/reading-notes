## [6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
- Greater efficiency
- Engaged collaboration
- Learning from fellow students
- Social skills
- Job interview readiness
- Work environment readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
- For me, I would say the first three are the top three.  It will add an extra set of eyes to catch any mistakes. It forces you to work with others. And in doing so either you can teach, or be taught be a fellow peer. Since everyone has a learned way of doing things, pair programming allows for a wide spread of ideas to come together

3.How does pair programming work?
- One person acts as the "Driver" = the person typing on the keyboarding and inputting values
- One person acts as the "Navigator" = uses words to guide the driver along the route, with the ideas, and scanning for any mistakes
