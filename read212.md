## [JavaScript Canvas](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/web-apis/javascript-canvas/)

1. What does the `<canvas>` allow a developer to achieve?
- allows you to draw 2D graphics using JavaScript. The `<canvas>` element requires at least two attributes: `width` and `height` that specify the size of the canvas

2. What is the importance of the closing `</canvas>` tag?
- Unlike the `<img>` element, The `<canvas>` element requires the closing tag `</canvas>`. Any content between the opening and closing tags is fallback content that will display only if the browser doesn’t support the `<canvas>` element.

3. Explain what the` getContext()` method does.
- Initially, the canvas is blank. To draw something, you need to access the rendering context and use it to draw on the canvas. The `<canvas>` element features the `getContext()` method that returns a render context object.  The` getContext()` takes one argument which is the type of context. For example, you use the "2d" to get a 2D rendering context object, which is an instance of the CanvasRenderingContext2D interface.
